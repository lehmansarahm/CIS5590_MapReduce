BUILDING THE CODE BASE
-----------------------------
	- This code base can be bundled into a JAR file using the "build.xml" file at the project root.
	- If the developer is using Eclipse, the file may be right-clicked and run as an Ant build file.
	- If the developer wishes, the file may also be run using Ant from the command line.
	- The resulting JAR and MANIFEST files will be written to the "bin/jar" directory until the project root.
	
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-----------------------------
	- The program requires an active installation of Java and Hadoop on the target machine in order to run.
	- The program may be run from the command line with the following instruction:
		> [Hadoop install dir] jar CIS5590_MapReduce_Lehman.jar [optional: [processing type] [input dir] [output dir]]
		Example:
		> /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop jar CIS5590_MapReduce_Lehman.jar
	- If no arguments are provided for processing type, input directory, or output directory, the following default values will be used:
		- processing type:  basic (searching for words "economy", "education", "government", "sports")
			- other options:  popular (searching for most popular words over five letters long for each country)
		- input directory:  ./input (folder of text files in current execution directory)
		- output directory:  ./output (will be overwritten if already exists)
	- NOTE THAT EXECUTION PARAMETERS MUST BE INCLUDED IN DESIGNATED ORDER
		- All three arguments may be omitted, but if a given argument is included, all preceding arguments must also be included
		- i.e. processing type may be included without any other arguments, but output directory may not be included without also including processing type and input directory
